# Unexpected Counter Increment in Next.js 15 Client-Side useEffect Hook

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in a Next.js 15 application.  A counter on the About page, implemented using `useEffect` with `setInterval`, increments far more rapidly than the intended 1-second interval after the initial page load.

## Issue Description
The counter should increase by one every second. However, it increases at a much faster pace after the initial render, possibly related to hydration or re-renders.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`.
5. Observe the rapidly increasing counter.

## Solution
The solution involves optimizing the `useEffect` hook to prevent unnecessary re-renders and ensure the interval is correctly managed during hydration and subsequent updates.  Specifically, ensure `setInterval` is only called once during component mount and `clearInterval` is called to cleanup in component unmount.  See `aboutSolution.js` for the fix.
